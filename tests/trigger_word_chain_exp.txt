Explanation on how the trigger_word_chain works
so fat this is recorded at 15Th Feb

- we have none intents when none of these intents are recognized, we  accept the user input then

- Parse it to CHATGPT and append "do you want prayer or counselling(Though we did not use GPT yet, for saving
we used out own text)

- Then the user can enter prayer or counselling which is an intent without topic
this will continue the chain 

or the user can enter prayer for marriage or counselling on greed this is an intent with topic
This will run and end the chain

- if no topic is detected we then ask prayer for what or counselling for what
we expect prayer for counselling or prayer for marriage

- Then when this input is entered it will then run with intent and topic and produce an output and will end the chain
