Faith Statement of New Testament International Evangelical Ministry(NTIEM)

At New Testament International Evangelical Ministry (NTIEM), our faith is anchored in the eternal truths of Scripture and the redemptive work of Jesus Christ. 
We affirm that our beliefs are not merely human philosophies, but divinely revealed truths designed to transform lives and guide our daily walk with God. Our faith statement is a declaration of the foundational doctrines that shape our identity and mission.

1. The Authority of Scripture
We uphold that the Bible is the inspired and inerrant Word of God. Comprising sixty-six books, Scripture is the definitive basis and standard of our faith and practice. 
Every teaching, tradition, and transformation in our ministry is measured against this sacred text. The Bible serves as our moral compass, a repository of divine wisdom, and the ultimate authority in discerning truth for every generation.

2. The Triune Nature of God
Our belief is rooted in the eternal mystery of the Trinity: God eternally manifests Himself in three distinct persons—God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. 
This foundational truth underscores the dynamic and relational nature of God. It is within this divine communion that the entirety of creation finds its purpose, and through which the plan of salvation is intricately woven.

3. The Person and Work of Jesus Christ
Central to our faith is the recognition of Jesus as the Christ—the Anointed One sent to redeem humanity. 
Jesus was miraculously born of a virgin, living a life completely free from sin. His sinless life exemplifies perfect obedience and divine grace. In His sacrificial love, He willingly offered Himself to die for the sins of mankind, demonstrating the depth of God’s mercy and the cost of our redemption.

4. The Death, Resurrection, and Ascension of Christ
We proclaim that Jesus was crucified, died, and was buried as a substitute for sinners. 
On the third day, He rose from the dead, an event witnessed by many, affirming His victory over death and sin. 
His bodily ascension to heaven, where He is now seated at the right hand of God, assures us of His eternal reign and intercession on behalf of all believers.

5. The Creation, Fall, and Need for Redemption
God created man in His own image for the purpose of fellowship with Him. However, through sin, humanity became estranged from the Creator, a separation that no human effort can mend. 
We believe that man is unable to save himself; redemption comes solely through the forgiveness of sins offered in the sacrifice of Christ’s death and validated by His resurrection. This truth calls us to a humble reliance on God’s grace.

6. Salvation by Grace Through Faith Alone
Our salvation is a gift of grace, received by faith alone and not earned by works. 
This doctrine of sola fide is central to our understanding of the Gospel—it emphasizes that no amount of human effort or moral achievement can secure our redemption. 
Instead, it is solely through faith in Jesus Christ that we are saved, highlighting the unmerited favor of God toward all who believe.

7. The Reality of Heaven and Hell
We affirm the literal existence of both Heaven and Hell. 
Heaven is a place of eternal comfort, joy, and communion with God for the saved. In contrast, Hell is a place of eternal torment for those who reject God’s offer of salvation. 
This duality reinforces the gravity of our earthly choices and the eternal consequences that follow.

8. The Baptism and Infilling of the Holy Spirit
The Baptism of the Holy Spirit, evidenced by speaking in tongues, is available to every believer. 
This experience is not a one-time event but a continuous occurrence, empowering us for service, spiritual growth, and deeper intimacy with God. The Holy Spirit’s presence is a vital, ever-renewing source of strength and guidance in our daily lives.

9. Water Baptism by Immersion
Water Baptism, performed by immersion, symbolizes a believer’s public attestation to their new identity in Christ and their commitment to the body of believers. This act represents the death of the old self and the resurrection of a renewed life, underscoring the transformative power of the Gospel.

10. Divine Healing
We believe that God has provided for the supernatural healing of the body and mind—a privilege accessible to every believer. Through prayer, faith, and the power of the Holy Spirit, divine healing is a testament to God’s compassion and His desire to restore us to wholeness.

11. The Indwelling of the Holy Spirit
The Holy Spirit indwells every believer, enabling us to lead lives that are pleasing to God. This indwelling presence empowers us to overcome challenges, pursue righteousness, and experience the fullness of God’s blessings. It is the Spirit’s guidance that leads to a successful and fulfilling Christian life.

12. The Second Coming of Christ
Lastly, we hold with hope and anticipation that Jesus Christ will return from heaven to gather His Church and usher in the eternal Kingdom. This promise of His imminent return motivates us to live with purpose and urgency, always ready to meet our Savior.

In summary, the faith of New Testament International Evangelical Ministry(NTIEM) is built on these unchanging truths. They form the cornerstone of our ministry, guiding us in our teachings, community life, and global mission. Through our unwavering commitment to Scripture and the redemptive work of Christ, we strive to live out these truths daily, reflecting the love and grace of God to the world.
