At New Testament International Evangelical Ministry (NTIEM), our mission is grounded in the timeless truths of the Gospel and propelled by a commitment to see lives transformed by the power of Christ. 
Under the visionary leadership of Apostle Uche Raymond, NTIEM has embraced a threefold mission: declaring the message of the Gospel, strengthening the churches of God, and facilitating career missionaries on global mission projects. 
This mission serves as the heartbeat of our ministry, guiding us in every endeavor and outreach.

### Declaring the Message of the Gospel

Central to NTIEM’s mission is the bold and unwavering declaration of the message of the Gospel. We believe that the Good News of Jesus Christ is not only the foundation of faith but also the catalyst for personal and societal transformation. 
Our ministry is dedicated to sharing the life-changing message of salvation, hope, and redemption with all people, regardless of their background. Through dynamic preaching, inspirational teaching, and engaging media outreach, we work tirelessly to ensure that the power of God’s word reaches every corner of the world. 
New Testament International Evangelical Ministry (NTIEM) organizes public sermons, local evangelistic events, and digital campaigns, all aimed at making the Gospel accessible and relevant. Our commitment is to create platforms where truth is communicated clearly, and lives are touched by the love and grace of God.
